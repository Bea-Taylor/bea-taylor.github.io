I have a PhD from the Centre for Medical Image Computing UCL, which focussed on the development and application of ML & disease progression models to improve understanding of the rarer dementias. Prior to that my undergrad was in pure Maths. I’m interested in applied machine learning, mathematical modelling, public policy and (unrelatedly) knitting.\nFor more info about my research interests and publications see my UCL profile , and my Google Scholar.\n\nEducation\nUniversity College London, London PhD in Computer Science | Feb 2021 - Sept 2024\nUniversity of Warwick, Warwick MMath in Mathematics | Sept 2016 - June 2020\n\n\nInterests\nKnitting.
