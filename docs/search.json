    "text": "Headlines about temporary accommodation. Cost to council to put them up. High rates of council bankruptcy, high rates of homelessness. Here look at the situation in London, and what state owned housing is being constructed in London.\n\nYou might have seen the headlines the past week, about the building temporary accommodation crisis in the UK. People are being failed by the private market (they can’t access it, or they’ve been pushed out of it), and turning to the state to house them. Typically the council then triages people according to priority. For those deemed in need (how they deem who is and isn’t in need is questionable), they then have to provide accommodation. Historically this would have been state owned accomodation, i.e. what traditionalyl in the UK has been council housing. However councils don’t have enough council housing available, and are forced to put individuals in accommodation the council leases from the private sector. Because of the high demand the free-market drives these prices up, leading to the eye-watering costs being reported.\nHigh cost to councils to put them up because they don’t have state owned accommodation available – i.e. traditionally what has been council housing in the UK.\n\nWhat happened to all the state owned housing?\nWe do still have council hosuing in the UK, but the rates it’s being built at has seen a sharp decline since it’s peak in the 1950s (when all the sick brutalist sites, which have now been gentrified were built). This is compunded by a large scale sell off of council housing to homeowners since the introduction of right to buy under Thatcher in 1980. A more recent trend has seen councils handing hosuing over to subsidiary housing auhtorities.\nThe rate of sell off has somewhat platead, but as youn can see in fig.A, the stock of state owned hosuign has declined significantly over time.\nThere has been a lot of controversies around the old stock of council owned hosuing, with significant issues maintaining the homes to an accessible standard (black mould, flooding etc), seemingly due to councils struggling to renovate these properties largely due to financial constraints.\nThis got me wondering, is any new council hosuing actually being built?\n\n\n100 units and counting\nWe can look at the London Planning Datahub to try and see what housing is actually being built. The London Planning Datahub is a dataset I’ve recently been working with, it’s an open dataset of all planning applications maintained by the Greater London Authority (GLA). Looking across all 33 local authority districts on London (the 32 boroughs plus City of London), we can start to see what council hosuing they’ve proposed since the pandemic.\nSo there is council housing being built, but it appears to be small pockets of infill coucil housing. Yes, small pockets of infill council housing. Often built on small plots of land, such as former garages, end of terraces, or carparks. These plots tend to be &lt;0.25 hectares, GLA small sites.\nTypically small scale (x residential units), and modestly sized (x rooms per residential unit).\nBut, they are high quality. Heatpumps, solar panels, accessible. Furthermore they’re nice looking, with notable RIBA winners (I certainly prefer them to the ‘New London Vernacular’ which dominates the private new build market in London).\n\n\nIncoherent thoughts\nSituation, desperately need housing to fix the crisis. Have some old stock which is in a bad state, plus have some new builds coming to market which are extremely high quality. It’s great that they are high quality, nice to live in and sustainable for both the people and planet. But, have gaping hole of housing problems, and it’s like they’re trying to plug it with tiny marbles. So, question is, are councils forced to build this type of housing because they don’t have the money to build more? Don’t have the resources to build more? It’s better value than retrofitting old stock of housing (they don’t have enough in house ways to do this – all through expensive contractors, so ends up being taken on by housing authority or developers, but then rising costs (or just capitalism) lead to the spaces becoming privatised)? Don’t have the physical space to build more (probably not, as some councils do have space, i.e. large brownfield sites, and they still aren’t building more)?\n\nThe code for the graph can be found here.\n\nThanks to Adam Dennett and Adham Enaya for their help with this research"

    "text": "You might have seen the headlines in the past week, about the crisis in council finances linked to the rising costs of providing temporary accommodation. Local authorities in the UK have a prevention duty, a statutory obligation to mitigate people becoming homeless. Historically, the states intervention would have been to identify suitable council housing. However councils don’t have enough council housing available, and are instead are locating individuals in accommodation the council leases from the private sector. These private owners, which could be private landlords, hostels or hotels, are then able to extract high prices from desperate councils. In the last x years, the number of people owed a duty of prevention has reached x, leading to some councils spending over 20% of their budget on securing temporary accommodation. The rise in homelessness in the UK is intrinsically linked to other aspects of the UK housing crisis: poor renters rights, soaring housing prices, and an old stock of housing, to name but a few.\nCouncil finances in England are already in a bad state, with multiple councils having declared bankruptcy in recent years, leading to a range of issues providing local welfare services. The temporary accommodation councils have provided has also been controversial; firstly it is often not temporary, with people stuck in this accommodation limbo for years, and secondly the accommodation provided is not suitable for living in, with notable examples lacking space, cooking facilities, or even windows making the news. This is perhaps particularly disturbing considering that in 2024, 25% of households owed a relief duty were families with children.\nThe most obvious solution to the temporary accommodation crisis, would be if there was suitable council housing available. Aware that a lack of all housing is a factor in the current housing crisis, the UK government has set ambitious hosuebuilding targets for their term in office, including 81,000 residential units per year in London. The London Plan 2021 developed by the Greater London Authority (GLA) set a slightly more modest goal of 66,000 resdiential units per year in the capital, of which 50% should be ‘’affordable’’’, a category which includes traditional council housing. This got me wondering what, if anything, councils have been doing to address the lack of council housing:\nHere I’m going to look specifcally at the situation in London, the city I live and work in, the city there is publicly acessible data for, and the city which is at the epicentre of the UK housing crisis."
