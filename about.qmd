Hi, I’m Bea. I'm a postdoc in the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL, working on applying machine learning methods to understand the London planning system. I have a PhD from the Centre for Medical Image Computing UCL, which focussed on the development and application of ML & disease progression models to improve understanding of the rarer dementias. Prior to that my undergrad was in pure Maths. I’m interested in applied machine learning, mathematical modelling, public policy and (unrelatedly) knitting.

For more info about my research interests and publications see my [UCL profile](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/82618-beatrice-taylor) , and my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RPKzlgoAAAAJ&hl=en).
