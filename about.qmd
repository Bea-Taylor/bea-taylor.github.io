:::{#hero-heading}

Hi, I’m Bea. I'm a postdoc in the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at UCL, working on applying machine learning methods to understand both the London planning system, and subsequently what is being constructed in London. 

I have a PhD from the Centre for Medical Image Computing UCL, which focussed on the development and application of ML & disease progression models to improve understanding of the rarer dementias. 

I’m interested in applied machine learning, mathematical modelling, public policy and (unrelatedly) knitting.

### Education

University College London, London 
 PhD in Computer Science | Feb 2021 - Sept 2024

University of Warwick, Warwick
 MMath in Mathematics | Sept 2016 - June 2020

<!-- ### Interests

I'm interested in the intersection of computational models and societal problems. How can we use techniques from maths and computer science to improve our understanding of problems like accurate dementia diagnosis, or increasing the build out rate to address the housing crisis? And then how do we communicate this understanding in a way that empowers others to act on this knowledge? -->
